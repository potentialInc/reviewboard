# Protected paths — agent edits are blocked for these prefixes.
# Managed by humans only. Used by:
#   - cli/src/core/rules.ts (TypeScript fallback)
#   - hooks/pre-edit-arch-check.sh (Shell fallback)
#   - architecture/enforce.sh (CI enforcement)
#
# One path per line. Trailing / means directory prefix match.
